# TruScanThe basis of TruScan is a user friendly way to test emails, or text message or if I can figure out how to code it properly be able to drop a screen shot in so if they were to receive a pop up scam like the Microsoft tech support scam where it shows your computer has been infected and to call. The main focus is to make it as easy to use as possible, ideally I would like to be able to add a short video modal to the right of the main image on the scan page that gives a quick tutorial. <img width="468" height="263" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7479e30e-38e8-4b7b-8d24-ec271db16915" />
